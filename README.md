# Light Up Piano Buttons Module for Space-Themed Sensory Table

## Project Overview
The Light Up Piano Buttons module is a part of the Space-Themed Sensory Table designed to aid adults with disabilities in managing overstimulation. This module provides an interactive and sensory-rich experience, focusing on auditory, visual, and tactile stimulation. Users can press the buttons to hear corresponding piano notes and see the buttons light up, creating a playful and engaging environment.
